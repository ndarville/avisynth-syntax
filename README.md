AviSynth syntax for Sublime Text 3
==================================
I have only just started working on this, but if you found your way to this project and want to try it out, use the installation instructions for [my other similar project][liquid] and replace the repo URL with this one.

I used the [AviSynth wiki section on syntax highlighters][wiki] to build the highlighter, but it seems to lack a few things. Itâ€™s still your best place to start if you want to do your own highlighter for another editor.
